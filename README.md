# Christmas Code Hunt 2023
My solutions to the [Shuttle.rs](https://www.shuttle.rs) [Christmas Code Hunt 2023](https://www.shuttle.rs/cch)

## Usage
This repo uses [just](https://github.com/casey/just) to run common commands.
You'll need to install the following in order to use the `just` commands:
- [cargo-shuttle](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle) - the shuttle.rs CLI
- [cargo-watch](https://github.com/watchexec/cargo-watch) - runs commands when files change
- [hurl](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/hurl) - a declarative HTTP endpoint test tool

With everything installed, you can run the following commands:
```sh
# Compile, run, and test endpoints
just test

# Watch for file changes and run `just test` as needed
just watch
```

### Project Layout
Each challenge day has a separate file in [./src/](./src/).
Each of these files exposes a `get_routes() -> axum::Router` function, including all of the endpoints for that day.
These routes all include their day's path number, as required by Shuttle.rs CCH.
[./src/main.rs](./src/main.rs) uses all of these `get_routes` functions to build the complete `Router`, and has the `#[shuttle_runtime::main]` attribute applied.

The [./tests/](./tests/) directory contains [Hurl Files](https://hurl.dev/docs/hurl-file.html).
These files describe HTTP requests and assert the responses that should be generated by our endpoints.
They are used to test our endpoints vs CCH example outputs and some other edge cases.
For organizational purposes, each challenge day has a separate `.hurl` file.
